                    of

                    any participation fees onlyin case of damage to JPR car as this will be considered as full coverage.
                    This
                    limitation on payment and participation fees apply only to damages caused to the Rental Vehicle and

                    not
                    cover damage, injury and death to the renter, passengers or third parties. For avoidance of doubt,

                    will be charged for additional full day rate based on the above conditions.</p>

                    has
                    provided the necessary information and reports for the application of insurance coverage.</p>
